Ingredients

265ml milk (you can also use water)
11g sodium citrate
285g grated cheddar cheese
1 tsp dijon mustard
sea salt, to taste

Method

Combine the milk (or water) and sodium citrate in a pot. Whisk to dissolve and bring to a simmer.
Add the cheddar cheese gradually, whisking to dissolve as you do. The original recipe calls for an immersion blender to do this, but I found that whisking fine grated cheddar was fine, and quick too.
Add the mustard and season to taste.
